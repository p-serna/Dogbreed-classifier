# Dog breed classifier

Dog breed classifier project for Udacity

## About

Task: classifying dog breeds with conv network and achieve relatively high accuracy. We will use transfer learning and pre-trained networks to aid us in this quest.

Following/forked [udacity repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch).
